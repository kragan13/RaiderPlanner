Steelbeast: I ran into issues with the command line version of git as I was attempting to use it on my home computer and from that point on 
I began using the browser version of git as I got farther into the project. 

nero228: I had a few issues understanding the windows version of git, but it does seem to be very simple in design. I don't like the command line version of git, and as a team we decided to use the windows version to help those who have trouble with command line.

kragan13: I have previously attempted (in the past) to use git in linux and struggled somewhat, so for simplicity I did my parts of merging pull requests and identifying changes made directly through github. This worked out well as github is actually a very useful tool for working with git. One issue we had as a team only was realized recently when I noticed that Daniel had not actually made a pull request for his work. I believe this happened because he was using visual studio and most likely that application did something differently that we were unaware of and his changes were committed directly to the master branch.
