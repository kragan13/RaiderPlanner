Identify three branching strategies:

1. GitHub Flow - GitHub Flow is a simple branching strategy in which anytime someone works on an issue, they create a new branch.
When finished, it is merged back into master. This allows for everyone working on the project to easily be able to work on separate issues
with no problems. This also makes undoing changes easier than if you directly commit to the master branch.

2. Pull requests from forks: This strategy is simply described in its title. By having a fork for each user and using pull requests to combine them whe needed it helps to control the clutter than multiple random branches can cause and allows admins to look at the pulls and decide if they help or hurt the project. https://hackernoon.com/a-branching-and-releasing-strategy-that-fits-github-flow-be1b6c48eca2

Our Branching idea: Our branches were just simple branches coming off the master in our own little fork of raiderplanner. We worked on them when needed and requested pulls when it fit our needs. It was all rather independent but it worked out well for our schedules.
