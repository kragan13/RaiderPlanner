1. Merged pull request from steelbeast (Matthew) which updated index.html by:
  - Adding normalize.css to the css files
  - Making normalize.css a "failsafe" stylesheet
  - Adding image alts

All changes were within the scope of the issue and were safe to merge with master, so the pull request was merged

Daniel had issues with his pull request and his changes appear to have been committed directly to the master branch, so I couldn't process a pull request from him.
