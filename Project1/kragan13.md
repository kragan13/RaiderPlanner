1. Merged pull request from steelbeast (Matthew) which updated index.html by:
  - Adding normalize.css to the css files
  - Making normalize.css a "failsafe" stylesheet
  - Adding image alts

All changes were within the scope of the issue and were safe to merge with master, so the pull request was merged
