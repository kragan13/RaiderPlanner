Issue # 11
https://github.com/gzdwsu/RaiderPlanner/issues/11
A lot of the other .html files were blank or had very little to them, so this idea of fixing these files was an easy idea to grasp for our group.
Branch used: master
Commit messages:
* Created the project1 folder and the .md files needed
* Added my requirement to conclusion.md
* updated the users.md and branching.md
* Added a basic structure to about.html and added to nero228.md
These commits did the bare basics in committing to a project, they did there job but could've been done better with more code added to about.html
Pull request name: About.html creation and edited
