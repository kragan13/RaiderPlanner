Issue: Number 13 https://github.com/gzdwsu/RaiderPlanner/issues/13
Research: Rather than there being a piece of code that is causing a problem the problem is a lack of code. Index.html, while it is operational, does not follow modern website standards. There is a readily avalible file called Normalize.css that is and has been used by plenty of actual web services to ensure that their website has something to display if the users browser cannot display what is being given to it. A good example is internet explorer. IE has trouble displaying many CSS stylings and tools which causes issues in websites that did not program for it. Normalize.css handles this issue by setting a basic standard for all web pages that most browsers will be able to run.
Branch: Index.html-updating
Main Commits: There were three main commits used to change the documents in this repository that were supplied by me.
1: Added line to use normalize.css file as final fail safe
2: Adding normalize.css file into css folder
3: Added picture alts
There were also several other commits that were simply creating folders and such that I am not including here.
Commit quality: These three main commits were helpful to the overall sturucture of index.html and added the possibility of other html files using normalize.css as they should be. However this did not take much code, simply a little bit of work and file uploading. More work is required to truly get the website up to modern website standards.
