    <!--<h1><b>About</b></h1>-->
    <p>Starting in December of 2016, RaiderPlanner has been an ongoing effort by dozens of Wright State University students. Modeled off of a schedule planner software
	called "PearPlanner", RaiderPlanner is designed specifically for students of WSU to use and help keep track of classes and assignments, as we all know it can
	get very hectic trying to keep track of homework, exams, and projects throughout the semester.</p><br>
	
	<p>This project started under Roberto Sanchez, a professor at WSU, for the class 'Introduction to the Design of Information Technology Systems', CEG 3120. The class mainly has taught
	students how to collaborate with others on a large project and work together to design something useful and interesting. It also teaches students how to work with 
	Git, via GitHub, which is where the RaiderPlanner project is based. Each student/group of students will fork the project and work on it to fix bugs, add features, or
	simply add on to what others have started. Currently, the class and the project are under the supervision of Guozhu Dong, the new instructor for the course. With
	students continuing to take the class, RaiderPlanner will continue to grow bigger and get closer to becoming something every WSU student could use.</p>
